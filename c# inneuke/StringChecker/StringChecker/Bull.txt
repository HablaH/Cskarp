In such cases, the letter y is pronounced as either the long vowel e or short or long i (usually as a long i when ending a word)—and, for all intents and purposes, it is a vowel. When y forms a diphthong—two vowel sounds joined in one syllable to form one speech sound, such as the "oy" in toy, "ay" in day, and "ey" in monkey—it is also regarded as a vowel.

Typically, y represents a consonant when it starts off a word or syllable, as in yard, lawyer, or beyond. Technically, this sound of \y\ is considered a semivowel or glide, which is a less prominent vowel speech sound that occurs in the articulation of two consecutive vowel sounds unequal in prominence. For example, there's a very brief long e sound when articulating \y\ in yes. Air flow is not impeded in sounding \y\ (if it was y would be a true consonant); however, the mouth is not opened as fully as in articulating the vowel \y\ in early. The result is a vowel-like consonant.

Linguistically, the "sometimes" part of the grade-school lesson doesn't make sense, since the letter y is more commonly pronounced as a vowel. But its consonant sound is unique, and that seems to be why y is more often considered to be a consonant and only "sometimes" a vowel. In other words, we need y more as a consonant in the English language than a vowel.
